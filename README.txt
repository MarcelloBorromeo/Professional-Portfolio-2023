## About This Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my early work as a sophomore at Arizona State University, where I began building a foundation in **data analytics, product strategy, and research-driven innovation**. I created this site to document my early projects, professional experiences, and applied learning in analytics, business, and technology.

At this stage of my career, I was exploring how data can inform business decisions, improve processes, and create measurable impact. I combined technical skills with curiosity and initiative, building this website from scratch with no prior web development experience.
